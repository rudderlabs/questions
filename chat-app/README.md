# chat-app


## Problem

Build a real-time chat application, where users are chatting with each other. 
Use [socket.io](http://socket.io) and NodeJS / or anything else.

Alice, Bob and Candy are the users. Anyone should be able to send a message to anyone else.

If X wants to send message to Y, they follow this syntax: Y: <message>
  
Eg: If Alice wants to say Hi to Bob, she types this `Bob: Hi`

***Server***
  
  `node server.mjs`
  
***Clients***
  
  `node alice.mjs`
  
  `node bob.mjs`
  
  `node candies.mjs`
  
**Requirements**

- Multiple users can start the client applications
- User should be able to send messages to other users
- User should be able to receive messages sent to them
- No authentication/authorization needed

Start from stratch and build an application that supports all the above use cases

Time limit: 45 min to 1 hour

Optional (Bonus):

- What happens to messages when one user is offline?
- List all online users
- Broadcast support
- How do we handle random order of starting/restarting the applications (Eg. Client starts before the server, Client reconnects to the server)
- A better CLI interface for sending and receiving messages
- Dockerize/Docker-compose the setup
